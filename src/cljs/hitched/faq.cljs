   ["Are there Ubers and Lyfts available?"
    "Uber and Lyft do operate in the area but there are limited drivers. Youâ€™ll likely have better luck in town or at the train station than out at our venue. There are a number of local taxi companies. We recommend making an advance booking to ensure availability."]

   ["What is the parking situation?"
    "There is plenty of parking at the venue. We will be providing a shuttle from the hotels in New Paltz to and from the venue if you would prefer not to drive."]

   ["Are there other wedding events I'm invited to?"
    "Yes! We'll be hosting a welcome gathering on Friday night and a farewell brunch on Sunday morning. See the When + Where page for details."]

   ["Is your wedding indoors or outdoors?"
    "Unless it's raining it will be a mix of both! You may be walking on grass so keep that in mind with your choice of footwear."]

   ["By when do I need to RSVP?"
    "Please RSVP by May 17th. You can RSVP here on our website or by mail with the RSVP card we sent you."]

   ["What if I have more questions?"
    "Please email us at codaline19@gmail.com"]])
